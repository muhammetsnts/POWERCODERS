Search result â€” Ramirez House

We found a few pieces of jewelry, none matching the stolen museum necklace.  
Work records and a signed timesheet confirm Fatima was working at a restaurant next to the museum at the exact time of the theft.  
Several witnesses from the restaurant also confirmed her presence.  
This evidence clears her from suspicion in the necklace case.

CLUE: There may be some hidden files in this address!!!
